# My Personal Project Proposal

The application I want to make is a short and fast game. It will be challenging and random. Similar in concept to a game like flappy bird by gameplay wise much different. The people who play this game will either be looking for a short and fun experience, or a challenging competition. This project is of interest to me, because games I enjoy games like these. I also believe that while the concept is simple there are numerous ways of creating complexity and depth. 



## Some of the things a user should be able to do
- play the game
- check their best time(s)
- be able to play different difficulties
- have fun



## User Stories
- As a user, I want to check my best time
- As a user, I want to dodge enemies
- As a user, I want to be able to change the difficulty
- As a user, I want to add my time to a leaderboard
